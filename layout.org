* colemak layout and emacs IME
I use colemak keyboard layout for more than five years.

I started using it when I needed [[https://colemak.com/Multilingual][multilungual]] keyboard layout.
It happened when I was learning German in Goethe Institut.
Unfortunately, by now I completely forget what I was learning,
but now I have this [[https://colemak.com/Ergonomic][ergonomic]] layout.
I can type in this layout without looking at keyboard,
and I can't do this with qwerty.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/cyrillic-colemak.el")
  
(setq default-input-method "cyrillic-colemak")
  
#+END_SRC
** enabling layout
